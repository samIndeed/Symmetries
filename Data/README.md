The data concerns the incidences of cancer as a function of age, and more precisely the biological focus for this work is to understand the increase in cancer due to ageing. Moreover, the data comes from the [*Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program*](https://seer.cancer.gov/), and more precisely it is the following database that has been used:<br>
*SEER*Stat Database: Incidence—SEER 18 Regs Research Data (2000–2016) (National Cancer Institute, DCCPS, Surveillance Research Program, Surveillance Systems Branch).*<br>
The data was accessed at November 2, 2015 and we have presented three datasets for three different cancer-types: Myeloma, Colon cancer and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML).
